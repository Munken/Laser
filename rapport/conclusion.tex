The kerr effect on the refractive index was worked out from the third nonlinear term of the polarization.
From this the self-fokusing effect was explainedcould be explaine by the inhomogeneous refractive index composition.
And the critical intensity for this effect to take place was presented for the cylendrical beam and the Gaussian beam, which was the point of departure for the numerical work. 

From the
