\chapter{Three-wave mixing}
\label{cha:mixing}


The Three-wave mixing is a property of the second order nonlinearity of the polarity dependence of the electric field, $\mathcal{E}(t)$. 
It is a phenomenon where the two waves mix together to a third. 



\section{Mathematical formulation and uses}
\label{sec:mixing-math}

To qualitatively examine the interaction between the two electromagnetic waves, of frequencies $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ with electric field amplitude $\mathcal{E}_1  \equiv \mathcal{E}(\omega_1)$ and $\mathcal{E}_1  \equiv \mathcal{E}(\omega_1)$ respectively, a superposition of these monochromatic plane waves is composed: 
\[
\mathbf{\mathcal{E}}(t) = \Re (\mathcal{E}_1e^{i(\mathbf{k_1} \cdot \mathbf{r} - \omega_1 t)}+\mathcal{E}_2e^{i(\mathbf{k_2} \cdot \mathbf{r} \omega_2 t)}),
\]
and put into the second order part of the polarity expansion \cite[sec.~21.2C]{saleh}
\begin{align}
     \mathbf{P}^{NL} & = \varepsilon_0 \chi^{(2)} \mathbf{E}^2(t) \nonumber \\
&= \varepsilon_0 \chi^{(2)} 2 \Re \left[
\left(|\mathcal{E}_1|^2+|\mathcal{E}_2|^2\right)e^{0} + |\mathcal{E}_1|^2e^{i2(\mathbf{k_1} z - \omega_1t)}+|\mathcal{E}_2|^2e^{i2(\mathbf{k_2} z - \omega_2t)} \right.\nonumber \\
& \left.
+ 2\mathcal{E}_1 \mathcal{E}_2e^{i((\mathbf{k_1} + \mathbf{k_2}) \cdot \mathbf{r} - (\omega_1+\omega_2)t)} 
+ 2\mathcal{E}_1 \mathcal{E}_2^*e^{i((\mathbf{k_1} - \mathbf{k_2}) \cdot \mathbf{r} - (\omega_1-\omega_2)t)} 
\right] \label{eq:MixPNL}.
\end{align}
Since this gives feedback to the electromagnetic field in \cref{eq:wave-general}, new frequencies are generated; $0$, the uninteresting one, $2\omega_1$ and $2\omega_2$, which are the original frequencies second harmonics, and more interesting, the sum and difference of the initial frequencies. The last two frequency couplings are often referred to as up- and down-conversion respectively.

It is clear that for the up- and down-conversion the third wave frequency will be:
\begin{equation}
  \label{qe:freqCond}
\omega_3 = \omega_1 \pm \omega_2
\end{equation}
and that a further phase matching constraint on the wave vector is necessary,
\[
\mathbf{k}_3 = \mathbf{k}_1 \pm \mathbf{k}_2,
\]
for a strong feedback in electric field change.

Physical this means that ones the third wave is created, it will also couple back to
the two other waves, but these constraints secures that a neutral interaction sustained through time and space. 




\section{Numeric formulation of up-conversion}
\label{sec:mixing-numeric}

To get a numerical interpretation of the result, one can assume the
\cref{qe:freqCond} and inject the up-conversion part of \cref{eq:MixPNL} into the time dependent wave equation of each wave \cite[Equation 3.39]{shen}:

\begin{align*}
\paren{ \pdiff{}{z}  + \frac{1}{v_i^{g}} } \mathcal{E}_i \paren{z, t}
&= \frac{i 2 \pi \omega_i^{2}}{k c^2} \mathbf{P}^{NL} \paren{z,t} e^{i \paren{k_i z - \omega_{i}
    t}} \Rightarrow \tag{3.39}\\
\paren{ \pdiff{}{z}  + \frac{1}{v_i^{g}} } \mathcal{E}_i \paren{z, t}
&= \frac{i \omega_i \chi^{(2)}}{2 n_i c} \mathcal{E}_j^{*}\mathcal{E}_k e^{i (k_3 - k_2 -k_1) z
  t}, \text{where } i \neq j \neq k \\
% \paren{ \pdiff{}{z}  + \frac{1}{v_1^{g}} } \mathcal{E}_1 \paren{z, t}
% &= \frac{i \omega_1 \chi^{(2)}}{2 n_1 c} \mathcal{E}_2^{*}\mathcal{E}_3 e^{i (k_3 - k_2 -k_1) z
%     t} \\
% \paren{ \pdiff{}{z}  + \frac{1}{v_2^{g}} } \mathcal{E}_2 \paren{z, t}
% &= \frac{i \omega_2 \chi^{(2)}}{2 n_2 c} \mathcal{E}_1^{*}\mathcal{E}_3 e^{i (k_3 - k_2 -k_1) z
%     t} \\
%   \paren{ \pdiff{}{z}  + \frac{1}{v_3^{g}} } \mathcal{E}_3 \paren{z, t}
%   &= \frac{i \omega_3 \chi^{(2)}}{2 n_3 c} \mathcal{E}_1\mathcal{E}_2 e^{i (k_3 - k_2 -k_1) z
%     t}, \\
\end{align*}
where the identity $\omega_i = k_ic$ has been used, and also the rotating wave
approximation and slowly varying amplitude approximation. These are equivalent to
the coupled partial differential
equations  (2) in \cite{bakker} and can be solved with the Runge-Kutta procedure
as described.

Typically this is done in KDP or KTP crystals such as the sum frequency conversion
done in \cite{sumFreq} where a 455 nm is med from a 807 nm and a 1062 source. Though only with an efficienty of $0.01\%$.

Multiple wave mixing can be optained at higher orders of nonlinearity terms, such
that the third order gives rise to four-wave mixing, but these will naturaly become
even more restrained.
